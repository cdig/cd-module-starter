		<h1>What Does It Mean to Circulate the Unit?</h1>
		<p>Putting the acid trailer into circulate mode means sending fluid into all of the components and flow paths that will be used during the job. This primes the pumps in the circuit, including the quintuplex.</p>
		<p>Circulating the unit also proves that a clear flow path exists, especially from the discharge manifold back to the displacement tanks. This is vitally important!</p>
		
		<cd-row>

				<p>
					What does it mean to prime a pump? Priming a pump means filling the pumping chamber with liquid. The centrifugal pumps are mounted well below the displacement tanks on the acid trailer; they will fill with fluid as soon as a flow path is opened to them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some pumps (especially centrifugal pumps) can’t pump at all without first being submerged in liquid.

		<h1>A Really Good Reason to Circulate</h1>
		
		<p>You’ll conduct a pressure test after circulating the unit for a few minutes. This involves pressurizing the lines from the quintuplex to the wellhead, holding that pressure for a moment, and then releasing that pressurized fluid back to the displacement tanks. But what if there was a blockage (ice, or maybe a stuck valve) in the line that returns the fluid to the tank?</p>
		
		<p>Imagine completing the pressure test procedure, and finding out that there is no path available to bleed that highly pressurized fluid back to the tanks safely. If the blockage is past the low pressure relief valve, that valve can open, and dump fluid back to the tank. But what if that blockage is preventing fluid from even reaching the relief valve? How will you safely release that high pressure fluid?</p>
		
		<p>This is why it is so important to make certain you have a clear path past the relief valve and back into the tank before engaging the quintuplex pump!</p>

	<page id="when-circulate-happens">
	
	<main>
		<h1>When Does Circulate Happen?</h1>
		
		<p>Circulation is started after the acid trailer has taken on fluid. The unit will stay in circulation mode until you are ready to pressure test, and start acidizing.</p>
	</main>
	
	<img src="assets/acid-unit-wide-shot.jpg">
	
	<main>
		<p>The unit may be in circulation mode for a prolonged amount of time. On cold days, circulation keeps water flowing through the plumbing to prevent freeze up.</p>
	</main>
	
</page>
	<page id="what-it-looks-like">
	
	<main>
		<h1>What Does Circulation Actually Look Like?</h1>
		<p>
			Fluid flows from the displacement tanks, to the charge pump, and into the quintuplex pump.
			The flow from the charge pump pushes through the suction and discharge valves of the quintuplex,
			and returns to the displacement tanks.
		</p>
		
		<cd-row>
			<img class="size-2" src="assets/circulate.png">
			
			<cd-text-bubble>
				Always begin circulation with the quintuplex pump OFF. (Don’t worry - the charge pump will push the fluid right through it.)

		<h1>Verify a Safe Flow Path</h1>
		
		<cd-row>
			<div>
				<p>Before engaging the quintuplex, get a visual confirmation that flow is returning to the displacement tanks under the power of the charge pump. This indicates that the return path is clear.</p>
				<p>Once you have confirmed this, you can engage the quintuplex pump.</p>
				<p class="caution">Remember, the quintuplex pump should never been engaged if the operator is out of the cab!</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Putting the unit into circulate mode means sending fluid through all of the flow paths and pumps that will be used during the job.</li>
			<li>Priming a pump means filling its pumping chamber with fluid.</li>
			<li>Circulation serves two purposes:
				<ul>
					<li>priming the charge and quintuplex pumps,</li>
					<li>proving that a clear flow path exists through the entire circuit, but especially from the quintuplex pump to the displacement tanks.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>The quintuplex pump can be on or off while fluid is circulated.</li>
			<li>It is especially important that circulation is confirmed before the quintuplex pump is engaged.</li>

This branch is for experimental v2 work. Do not use.

## Getting Started

Take the `dist` folder, name it whatever your module name is, and put it somewhere else. Delete the cd-module-template folder.

`cd` into your new module folder, and then run the following:

```bash
npm install
bower install
```

## Getting Down To Work

After you have a module set up and ready to be worked on, here's how you fire it up.

`cd` into the module folder, and then run the following:

```bash
gulp
```

That'll compile all your files, and open up a browser window with a running instance of browser-sync. Any changes you make to the files in `source` will be immediately compiled, and the browser will be updated accordingly.

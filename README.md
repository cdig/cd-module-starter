## Updating an existing module to the latest version

2. cd to the module folder.
3. Run `bower update`.
4. Refresh CodeKit.
5. Recompile index.kit, libs.js, scripts.coffee, and styles.scss

## What's in the box?

This repo contains a bare-bones skeleton of a module, ready for you to flesh out with content.

It used to also contain an "example" project, but that was languishing, so it was removed to avoid
spreading misinformation.

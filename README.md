# cdModule Template

## There Will Be Bugs
This is still an alpha! The format for modules is rapidly evolving, and as such, this template project might lag a bit behind the current state of the art. I will try really hard to keep it updated. But if something seems fishy, it probably is.

### Dependencies
Includes cdReset, cdModule in `bower_components`. So, you need Bower? Also, includes a ready-to-use `config.codekit`. So you should use CodeKit.
